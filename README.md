## Error Handling

The application includes middleware for error handling. It ensures proper validation and responses for various errors such as validation errors, authentication errors, and server errors.

## Authentication & Authorization

- JWT is used for authentication.
- Routes are protected based on user roles (`admin` or `user`).

## Future Improvements

- Add frontend interface for a better user experience.
- Implement email notifications for booking confirmations and updates.
